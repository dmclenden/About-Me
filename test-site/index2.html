      <center><h2>Hello!</h2></center>
    <p>My name is Desiree. I am 30 years old and was born in raised in Houston, TX. I am transtioning from Healthcare into Tech and I am excited to take this journey with you all. I am a problem solver by nature, artistic and creative but I was not blessed with the ability to draw. Tech has given me a way to still be able to create.</p>

    <center><h2>Why?</h2></center>
    <p>I wish I had a more inspirational, heart-warming story about why I want to get into tech but I donâ€™t. The truth is I need to make more money and tech has plenty of it.</p>

    <p><b>Am I passionate about coding?</b> Its definitely too early to say but it holds my attention. That counts for something right?</p>
